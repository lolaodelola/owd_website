<h1>Handover</h1>
<p>Hi folks!</p>
<p>Firstly, my apologies for how long this took! Thank you for trusting me with this and hopefully it meets your
satisfaction. If it doesn't, scrap it! Change what you need to, at the end of the day this should serve OWD visitors
first and foremost, their needs take priority.</p>
<p>Secondly, I've put together this short doc to include handover info &amp; stuff to note.</p>
<h2>Stuff</h2>
<ol>
<li>There are a number of TODO items in the codebase for you to have a look at, mainly stuff I don't have info for.
<ol>
<li><code>contribute/conference-organiser.html</code> includes a link intended for an email, you'll need to fill in w/ the
OWD contact email.</li>
<li><code>contribute/individual-contributor</code> includes a link that's intended to point to somewhere folks can either
find out more about contributing or the GH issues. There's been a lot of discussion of where this should lead
to without any decisions (that I'm aware of) - were we still waiting for MDN contribution hub?</li>
<li><code>README</code> includes a section on contributing (if you want to allow that), and needs to be filled in.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Membership has launched but there wasn't any copy for it, so it isn't on the site - you'll likely want to add it.</li>
<li>On <code>team.html</code> there are some basic web page icon (shown below). There are better icons on <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/search?word=web&amp;shape=outline&amp;order_by=4">flat icon</a> but to get
both
light &amp; dark versions or SVGs requires payment.
<ol>
<li><img src="./img/web-icon.png" alt="web icon"></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>I made a little favicon &amp; for the life of me I can't get it to display - if I could get a second set of eyes on
it that'd be great.</li>
<li>Delete this file :)</li>
</ol>
