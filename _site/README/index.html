<h1>Open Web Docs</h1>
<p>This is the codebase for <a href="https://openwebdocs.com">Open Web Docs</a>, it's run using <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a> and
you'll need to <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/getting-started/#step-2-install-eleventy">install it</a> to run the codebase locally.</p>
<h2>Run Locally</h2>
<p>Once you've installed 11ty, you can run this codebase locally by running <code>@npx @11ty/eleventy --serve</code> in your
terminal. This will create a <code>_site</code> directory which will include all the site files. You shouldn't make changes to
these files, instead you'll want to make changes to files and directories in the root directory. If you want to
include a new directory that you want outputted to the browser, you'll need to add it to the list of dircetories in
<code>.eleventy.js</code>; for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">    // Copy `img/` to `_site/img`
  eleventyConfig.addPassthroughCopy(&quot;img&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>adds the <code>img</code> directory to <code>_site</code> so that it can be output to the browser.</p>

<h3>Gotchas</h3>
<p>There are some things to be aware of when making changes.</p>
<ol>
<li>The index/home page doesn't use the same footer as the rest of the pages. If you're making changes to the footer
ensure that you don't need to change the index footer <strong>and</strong> <code>_includes/partials/footer.njk</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>theme.css</code> includes rules for <code>prefers-color-scheme(&quot;dark&quot;)</code> and <code>body.dark</code> which are exactly
the same this is so that folks can use dark mode regardless of their system preferences. If you make changes to one, ensure you
make changes to the other.
<ol>
<li>If you're making changes to dark mode ensure that you're prefacing all new rules with <code>body.dark</code> and <code>body. systemDarkPreference</code> respectively.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>For collections (posts, reports, worklog), there is an accomponying json file which includes global rules for the
files that live in the related directory; for example:<pre><code class="language-json">{
  &quot;layout&quot;: &quot;layouts/post.njk&quot;,
  &quot;tags&quot;: [
     &quot;post&quot;
 ]
}
</code></pre>
This is setting the layout for all posts and ensures that each post has the tag <code>post</code> so that all posts can be
included in the posts collection.</li>
<li>If you create a file that you don't want included in a collection, include <code>eleventyExcludeFromCollections: true</code> in the front-matter.</li>
</ol>
