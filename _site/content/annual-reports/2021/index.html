        <h1>Open Web Docs Impact and Transparency Report 2021</h1>
        <p></p>
        <p>By Florian Scholz, Will Bamberg, Jean-Yves Perrier, Estelle Weyl, Jory Burson</p>
<p>October 2021, updated January 2022</p>
<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>At the end of 2021, Open Web Docs is a
collective of 9 organizations and employs 4 full-time Senior Technical
Writers who have extensive experience with Web standards documentation
and MDN Web Docs.</p>
<p>The collective received $790,000 in donations from
organizations and 130 people backed or donated to Open Web Docs
individually.</p>
<p>Open Web Docs’ main focus has been contributions to MDN
Web Docs, the premier platform for Web platform documentation. It is
estimated that it has about 18 million monthly users and therefore OWD
contributions reach the vast majority of web developers.</p>
<p>In September 2021, OWD staff were responsible for
nearly half of the commits and more than half of the reviews to the
mdn/content GitHub repository.</p>
<p>Open Web Docs, working with a growing set of organizations getting
involved in supporting MDN Web Docs, has established a quarterly
prioritization process to work on key infrastructure and content work.
Projects in 2021 included: Migrating MDN content to Markdown,
Collaborating with the W3C to integrate specification data into browser
compatibility data (BCD) and MDN, co-leadership for the BCD project,
improvements to the information architecture of API docs, making API
docs more beginner friendly, and documenting WebXR.</p>
<h2>Outset</h2>
<p>In October 2020, Open Web Docs was created by Coil,
Google, Microsoft, Samsung, the W3C, Jory Burson, and Florian Scholz,
followed by the public launch on January 25, 2021. Created to ensure the
long-term health of web platform documentation on critical resources
like MDN Web Docs, independently of any single vendor or organization.
Through full-time staff, community management, and a network of partner
organizations, Open Web Docs enables these resources to better maintain
and sustain documentation of core web platform technologies. Rather than
create new documentation sites, Open Web Docs is committed to improving
existing platforms through our contributions.</p>
<h2>Public launch</h2>
<p>On January 25, 2021, Open Web Docs was launched publicly with an
overall very positive reaction from the Web community. The
<a href="https://twitter.com/OpenWebDocs/status/1353748877111918593">launch
tweet</a> had
473,760 impressions, and the <a href="https://opencollective.com/open-web-docs/updates/introducing-open-web-docs">launch blog
post</a> has
over 25,000 views. There are now <a href="https://opencollective.com/open-web-docs">147
contributors on Open
Collective</a>,
the <a href="https://twitter.com/OpenWebDocs">Twitter account
@OpenWebDocs</a> counts
1,915 followers and the project repository has
<a href="https://github.com/openwebdocs/project">298 stars on
GitHub</a>.
OWD also spent a long time being the #1 news on Hacker News
and the story was picked up on over
20 international press sites.</p>
<h2>Organizational growth</h2>
<p>In 2021, the following organizations joined the Open
Web Docs collective and actively participated in OWD committees.</p>
<p>Initial members:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coil</li>
<li>Google</li>
<li>Microsoft</li>
<li>Mozilla</li>
<li>Samsung Internet</li>
<li>W3C</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional members:</p>
<ul>
<li>Igalia (starting January 2021)</li>
<li>Facebook (starting May 2021)</li>
<li>JetBrains (starting July 2021)</li>
</ul>
<p>This increases the total number of organizations participating to
9 from the initial 6
organizations. Open Web Docs
provided an entry point for these organizations to get involved with Web
platform documentation and contributing to MDN Web Docs. The regular
exchange of knowledge and expertise has been very beneficial for all
parties involved.</p>
<p>Facebook:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We are honored to support the Open Web Docs initiative as it
leads the way in shaping the future of inclusive, extensive and quality
web documentation.”
<a href="https://twitter.com/JoelMarcey">Joel

</blockquote>
<h2>OWD staff team</h2>
<p>The Open Web Docs Governing Committee successfully hired
four talented Technical Writers &amp; Developer
Advocates with prior experience of Web Standards
documentation and MDN Web Docs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Florian Scholz joined in November 2020.</li>
<li>Will Bamberg joined in February 2021.</li>
<li>Jean-Yves Perrier joined in August 2021.</li>
<li>Estelle Weyl joined in August 2021.</li>
</ul>
<p>Florian Scholz and Will Bamberg were hired to preserve
talent from the former Mozilla MDN Content team. The public and open
hiring process for positions 3 and 4 was started in April 2021 and was
completed in August 2021, with Jean-Yves Perrier and Estelle Weyl
joining the team.</p>
<p>The first quarter with a full workforce will be Q4
2021.</p>
<h3>Diversity &amp; Inclusion</h3>
<p>Fostering diversity and inclusion in the tech industry is a core
value for Open Web Docs. We have put in place a
<a href="https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/blob/main/diversity-inclusion.md">diversity &amp; inclusion
policy</a> regarding
what events and communities we will participate in and we have signed on
to the <a href="https://diversitycharter.org/">Diversity
Charter</a>.
Our intention is that our program of work, including what we put effort
into and how we prioritise our activities, will also reflect this core
value.</p>
<h2>Steering committee</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/blob/main/steering-committee/membership-expectations.md">Open Web Docs Steering
Committee</a> consists
of two representatives from each participating organization and the OWD
staff team. The group holds weekly meetings for which
<a href="https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/tree/main/steering-committee/meetings/2021">meeting notes are available throughout the
year</a>.
The OWD Steering Committee operates in the open with
<a href="https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/blob/main/steering-committee/prioritization-criteria.md">vendor neutral prioritization
criteria</a> and
has an open prioritization process involving all Steering Committee
members on a quarterly
basis.</p>
<h2>OWD brand &amp; public channels</h2>
<p>Open Web Docs represents a community of Technical Writers and
advocates for the Open Web. In 2021, the focus hasn’t been
to build a strong succinct brand and voice. OWD
amplified and supported projects like MDN Web Docs and the Open Web in
general via our growing channels:</p>
<ul>
<li>1,915 Twitter followers
<a href="https://twitter.com/OpenWebDocs">https://twitter.com/OpenWebDocs</a></li>
<li>298 GitHub stars
<a href="https://github.com/openwebdocs/project">https://github.com/openwebdocs/project</a></li>
<li>147 open collect updates subscribers
<a href="https://opencollective.com/open-web-docs/updates">https://opencollective.com/open-web-docs/updates</a></li>
</ul>
<p>To keep OWD backers apprised of ongoing work, monthly worklog
posts are published
(<a href="https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/tree/main/steering-committee/worklog">archive</a>).
The OWD team also participates as invited guests on podcasts and
presents at Web related conferences. The JS Party podcast is an example
for this:
<a href="https://changelog.com/jsparty/165">https://changelog.com/jsparty/165</a>.</p>
<h2>Contributions to MDN Web Docs</h2>
<p>Open Web Docs’ main focus has been contributions to MDN
Web Docs, the premier platform for Web platform documentation. It is
estimated that it has about 18 million monthly users and therefore OWD
contributions reach the vast majority of web developers.</p>
<p>Open Web Docs is also interested in addressing web development
pain points as identified by the <a href="https://insights.developer.mozilla.org">MDN Web DNA
survey</a> and
is working with browser vendors and Steering Committee members alike to
identify and solve these problems. With web compatibility being the
number one web developer pain point, a focus has been to contribute to
<a href="https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data">mdn/browser-compat-data</a> (“BCD”)
in particular (a sub-project of MDN Web Docs).</p>
<p>Daniel Beck, MDN Web Docs Content Lead at
Mozilla:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“OWD is an important partner in the day-to-day
operational success of MDN Web Docs as an open source documentation
project. Without OWD’s contributions, a range of efforts, from Markdown
conversion to routine pull request reviews, would be slowed or delayed.
OWD’s participation means that MDN is a richer, more dynamic project
that it would be otherwise.</p>
<p>Above and beyond that, OWD, through its working
relationship with MDN and the collegial atmosphere of the OWD steering
committee, brings together a range of perspectives on the web as a
developer platform. The community, effort, and documentation shared
between MDN and OWD give form to Mozilla’s mission “to ensure the
Internet is a global public resource, open and accessible to
all.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Day-to-day work</h2>
<p>On a daily basis, the Open Web Docs staff team
contributes to the open source repositories of the MDN Web Docs GitHub
organization. The contributions can come in many forms (creating pull
requests, filing issues, reviewing pull requests, participating in
discussions, triaging issues) on a handful of repositories that are
foundational to MDN Web Docs.</p>
<p>In this document, two categories of contributions are
presented in more detail: Commits to mdn/content and reviews of pull
requests on mdn/content.</p>
<h3>Commits to mdn/content</h3>
<p>The following chart summarises, for each month from February to
December 2021, the number of commits to mdn/content made by every individual
who made more than 10 commits in that
month<sup><a href="#ftnt1">[1]</a></sup>. It assigns each
individual to one of four groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>OWD staff</li>
<li>Mozilla staff</li>
<li>W3C staff</li>
<li>Other (volunteers and people paid by other
organizations to work on MDN)</li>
</ul>
<p>It then sums the commits made by members of group to
get an idea of that group’s contributions to mdn/content, as measured by
number of commits:</p>

<p>Mozilla's lower activity is due to a change of staff, with a
position that took several months to backfill; in parallel, Open Web
Docs was building its workforce, compensating for it, illustrating the
resilience that OWD aims to provide to the ecosystem.</p>
<h3>Pull request reviews &amp; supporting MDN’s move to GitHub</h3>
<p>Until 2020, MDN was a Wiki which anyone could edit
without any review. This made it very hard to maintain the quality of
the documentation, but also meant external contributions were not
blocked by getting reviews from maintainers.</p>
<p>In 2020, MDN content
<a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/12/welcome-yari-mdn-web-docs-has-a-new-platform/">moved</a> into
the
<a href="https://github.com/mdn/content">mdn/content</a> GitHub
repo, meaning that all contributions would be in the form of pull
requests needing manual review before merging. One of the main concerns
around this was: would the PR review workload be sustainable for
MDN’s maintainers?</p>
<p>To keep MDN open and enable community contributions it’s essential
to be responsive to pull requests, so reviewing and merging pull
requests became a critical part of OWD’s work,
and a careful review of these pull requests is essential to preserving
MDN’s quality.</p>
<p>A year in from the GitHub move we can say that
MDN has successfully and sustainably managed the PR review
backlog.</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of PRs open at any given time has
fluctuated between about 40-70 over the course of the year.</li>
<li>Using the GitHub API we can see that in the second half of 2021, 3061 PRs were merged to MDN content (in total, not only by OWD staff),
an average 16.6/day.</li>
<li>This means MDN’s PR backlog represents about 3-5 days’ worth of pull requests.</li>
</ul>
<p>How much has OWD contributed to this? The mdn/content
PR review team can be seen as comprising four groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>OWD staff</li>
<li>Mozilla staff</li>
<li>W3C staff</li>
<li>Other (volunteers or people paid by other
organizations to work on MDN)</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the start of the year, the number of PR reviews made by each
group, per month, is as follows:</p>
<table>

<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>In addition to the day-to-day contributions to MDN Web Docs,
Open Web Docs works with its Steering Committee to identify
and invest in more substantive quarterly projects to address structural
needs or important gaps in the documentation coverage. In 2021, this
meant leading major content infrastructure and writing projects.</p>
<h3>Completed projects</h3>
<p>OWD completed the following major projects in 2021.</p>
<h4>Converting MDN content to Markdown</h4>
<p>In Q2 and Q3 Open Web Docs led a project to switch the
authoring format for mdn/content from HTML to GitHub-Flavored
Markdown.</p>
<p>HTML is a great language for Web pages but a difficult
format for writing or reviewing documentation. Switching to a more
readable format is essential for MDN's long-term sustainability. OWD led
this major infrastructure project, probably the biggest change to MDN
content in its history. The OWD staff:</p>
<ul>
<li>led a collaborative process to design a
Markdown-based authoring format expressive enough to reflect the
needs specific to MDN,</li>
<li>worked with Mozilla's MDN engineering team to
implement the changes in the platform to support Markdown,</li>
<li>updated thousands of pages to simplify the markup
and make it Markdown-compatible.</li>
</ul>
<p>In October we finished converting MDN pages to Markdown, with the exception
of a few pages which we intend to migrate off MDN in the near future.</p>
<p>We think this project has made it very much easier to write MDN documentation,
both for experienced writing staff and for volunteers.</p>
<h4>Integrating W3C data into MDN and BCD</h4>
<p>Open Web Docs drives the inclusion of data into
documentation, creating and enhancing existing data, and making such
data accessible outside of MDN’s content. Work in this field has been
done in close collaboration with the W3C, a provider of Web platform
data. Other organizations have provided feedback into this process as
well as data about the Web platform is of interest to browser vendors,
developer tooling products, and others alike.</p>
<p>Throughout the year, and together with the W3C, Open Web Docs
worked on updating MDN Web Docs’
Specification sections. MDN
reference pages use this section to link to the relevant specifications
for a Web platform feature. Unfortunately, these sections were outdated
most of the time and not machine readable. The manually maintained HTML
tables were also getting in the way of the
MDN’s conversion to
Markdown.</p>
<p>Thanks to the data from
<a href="https://github.com/w3c/browser-specs">w3c/browser-specs</a> and
adding spec_urls to the browser-compat-data project, MDN’s
specification links are now validated and up-to-date. A renderer was
added to Yari
(MDN’s backend) allowing for
future enhancements to all
Specification sections
at once in the future.</p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues/24</li>
</ul>
<p>Open Web Docs has also started to investigate integrating and
working with additional data for documentation using the
<a href="https://github.com/w3c/webref">w3c/webref</a> project
and working with WebIDL files. Long term, Open Web Docs envisions
<a href="https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues/34">MDN as a provider of structured
content</a>.</p>
<h4>MDN browser-compat-data (BCD) contributions</h4>
<p>Throughout 2021, Florian Scholz continued to act as a
co-owner of the mdn/browser-compat-data project and helped Daniel Beck
(Mozilla) run the project that powers the compatibility tables on MDN
and caniuse.com. Owning this open source project means helping with
making strategic decisions, managing releases, and enabling the project
to its full potential.</p>
<p>Major contributions to BCD in 2021 project
included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Helping with PR reviews on a day-to-day
basis.</li>
<li>Giving input and contributing to infrastructure,
schema, and governance questions.</li>
<li>Adopting semver and releasing BCD 3.0.0</li>
<li>Introducing spec_urls</li>
<li>Finding a solution to represent compat data for
“mixins”</li>
<li>Adding “preview” browsers and releasing BCD
4.0.0</li>
</ul>
<h4>Fixing mixins</h4>
<p>&quot;Mixins&quot;, in MDN's Web API documentation, represent interfaces that are
not themselves instantiable, but are inherited by multiple interfaces that are
instantiable. For example, the <code>WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope</code> mixin contains
properties that are available in both the <code>Window</code> and the <code>Worker</code> interface.</p>
<p>Since mixins are not instantiable and in some cases represent internal
implementation choices, they are confusing to users and should not be surfaced
in MDN's documentation.</p>
<p>Although in theory mixins avoid duplication, in practice the implementation of
a mixin in a given interface should have its own documentation anyway (for
example, code samples should use the concrete interface).</p>
<p>This project eliminated mixins by separating out the properties they listed and
documenting these properties in the concrete inheriting interfaces.</p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues/23</li>
</ul>
<h4>Beginner friendly documentation: syntax boxes</h4>
<p>To make documentation easier to understand and more
welcoming to new and aspiring web developers and designers world-wide,
Open Web Docs continuously investigates how to make content more
accessible to beginners.</p>
<p>In Q2 2021, Open Web Docs worked on a
<a href="https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues/26">project</a> to
make MDN reference pages more readable and easier to understand by
beginners by simplifying MDN’s syntax
sections. This change affected all of the
JavaScript and Web APIs pages.</p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues/26</li>
</ul>
<p>Open Web Docs aims to further simplify the MDN
reference pages overall, making them useful to a beginner audience and
offering a benefit to reading specifications that are targeted at
implementers and industry professionals.</p>
<h4>Documenting WebXR on MDN</h4>
<p>WebXR is a group of standards which are used together to support
rendering 3D scenes to hardware designed for presenting virtual worlds
(virtual reality, or VR), and for adding graphical imagery to the real
world, (augmented reality, or AR). In Q3 2021, the Open Web Docs
Steering Committee voted this topic as
impactful for the web community and
documentation work for features from 10 WebXR specifications got worked
on.</p>
<p>As part of this effort:</p>
<ul>
<li>131 new MDN reference pages were added.</li>
<li>78 pull requests were submitted to MDN.</li>
<li>MDN WebXR docs have been converted from HTML to
Markdown.</li>
<li>Community feedback on WebXR docs and guide material
needs has been collected.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Current projects</h3>
<p>OWD staff are currently working on the following projects, all of which
we expect to finish in the first or second quarter of 2022:</p>
<h4>ARIA documentation</h4>
<p>Writing complete documentation for ARIA roles and attributes.</p>
<p>ARIA is an important part of Web accessibility, and MDN's ARIA reference
documentation is currently patchy and very out of date. This project will
add any missing pages and update the existing ones.</p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/rfcs/aria-roles.md</li>

<h4>Updating DOM guides and reference</h4>
<p>The DOM is a fundamental part of the web that all developer have to understand.
MDN's DOM reference documentation is badly out of date and in many cases not
coherent.</p>
<p>This project will assess which updates are needed and make them.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h4>Modernizing the JavaScript Learning Area</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn">Learning Area on MDN</a> is
the place we expect new developers to start to learn web development. The
JavaScript section has not been systematically updated since it was created in
around 2016, and in many cases does not recommend modern development practices.</p>
<p>This project will assess the updates needed across the JavaScript Learning Area,
and apply them.</p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/rfcs/modernize-learn-js.md</li>
</ul>
<h4>Documenting events and representing them in BCD</h4>
<p>Events again are one of the fundamental aspects of web development, and the
way MDN documents events is confusing. One of the main problems is that
currently each event tends to be documented across two different pages:</p>
<ul>
<li>a page for the &quot;event handler property&quot; like <code>onclick</code></li>
<li>a page for the event, like <code>click</code> event</li>
</ul>
<p>This is confusing and doesn't properly reflect the fact that as a concept
there is only a single event, with different ways to attach a listener.</p>
<p>In this project we will describe the proper structure and content of an
MDN event reference page, and update all our event documentation
accordingly. This will entail writing or rewriting several hundred pages.</p>

<h2>Appendix on mdn/content metrics</h2>
<p>This appendix describes how we calculated the metrics for OWD
contributions to the
<a href="https://github.com/mdn/content/">mdn/content</a> repository.
It’s included here in the interest of transparency and as an invitation
to check the data.</p>
<p>We showed two metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of commits by OWD staff and by other
contributors</li>
<li>Number of pull request reviews by OWD staff and by
other contributors</li>
</ul>
<p>The data to back up the metrics is in the
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-7-jmrVCmsxb1adSujY8L5xxLIIV2MBTxL83AdW4Kfc/edit?usp%3Dsharing">OWD
metrics</a> spreadsheet.</p>
<h3>Number of commits</h3>
<p>To get these numbers we just looked at the mdn/content
contributors page, filtered by months, for each month from February to
December 2021:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mdn/content/graphs/contributors?from%3D2021-02-01%26to%3D2021-02-28%26type%3Dc">https://github.com/mdn/content/graphs/contributors?from=2021-02-01&amp;to=2021-02-28&amp;type=c</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mdn/content/graphs/contributors?from%3D2021-03-01%26to%3D2021-03-31%26type%3Dc">https://github.com/mdn/content/graphs/contributors?from=2021-03-01&amp;to=2021-03-31&amp;type=c</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mdn/content/graphs/contributors?from%3D2021-04-01%26to%3D2021-04-30%26type%3Dc">https://github.com/mdn/content/graphs/contributors?from=2021-04-01&amp;to=2021-04-30&amp;type=c</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mdn/content/graphs/contributors?from%3D2021-05-01%26to%3D2021-05-31%26type%3Dc">https://github.com/mdn/content/graphs/contributors?from=2021-05-01&amp;to=2021-05-31&amp;type=c</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mdn/content/graphs/contributors?from%3D2021-06-01%26to%3D2021-06-30%26type%3Dc">https://github.com/mdn/content/graphs/contributors?from=2021-06-01&amp;to=2021-06-30&amp;type=c</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mdn/content/graphs/contributors?from%3D2021-07-01%26to%3D2021-07-31%26type%3Dc">https://github.com/mdn/content/graphs/contributors?from=2021-07-01&amp;to=2021-07-31&amp;type=c</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mdn/content/graphs/contributors?from%3D2021-08-01%26to%3D2021-08-31%26type%3Dc">https://github.com/mdn/content/graphs/contributors?from=2021-08-01&amp;to=2021-08-31&amp;type=c</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mdn/content/graphs/contributors?from%3D2021-09-01%26to%3D2021-09-30%26type%3Dc">https://github.com/mdn/content/graphs/contributors?from=2021-09-01&amp;to=2021-09-30&amp;type=c</a></p>
<p>For each month, we noted the number of commits by every
contributor who made more than 10 commits. Then we grouped contributors
into:</p>
<ul>
<li>OWD staff</li>
<li>Mozilla staff</li>
<li>W3C staff</li>
<li>Other (volunteers and people paid by other
organizations to contribute to MDN)</li>
</ul>
<p>The process of excluding people who contributed 10
commits or fewer tends to disadvantage occasional volunteers.</p>
<h3>Number of pull request reviews</h3>
<p>To get these numbers we made a list of active reviewers
on MDN:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Elchi3">https://github.com/Elchi3</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/wbamberg">https://github.com/wbamberg</a></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Ryuno-Ki">https://github.com/Ryuno-Ki</a></p>
<p>For each reviewer we fetched their activity page,
filtered by each month, February to December. For example:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Elchi3?tab%3Doverview%26from%3D2021-02-01%26to%3D2021-02-28">https://github.com/Elchi3?tab=overview&amp;from=2021-02-01&amp;to=2021-02-28</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Elchi3?tab%3Doverview%26from%3D2021-03-01%26to%3D2021-03-31">https://github.com/Elchi3?tab=overview&amp;from=2021-03-01&amp;to=2021-03-31</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Elchi3?tab%3Doverview%26from%3D2021-04-01%26to%3D2021-04-30">https://github.com/Elchi3?tab=overview&amp;from=2021-04-01&amp;to=2021-04-30</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Elchi3?tab%3Doverview%26from%3D2021-05-01%26to%3D2021-05-31">https://github.com/Elchi3?tab=overview&amp;from=2021-05-01&amp;to=2021-05-31</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Elchi3?tab%3Doverview%26from%3D2021-06-01%26to%3D2021-06-30">https://github.com/Elchi3?tab=overview&amp;from=2021-06-01&amp;to=2021-06-30</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Elchi3?tab%3Doverview%26from%3D2021-07-01%26to%3D2021-07-31">https://github.com/Elchi3?tab=overview&amp;from=2021-07-01&amp;to=2021-07-31</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Elchi3?tab%3Doverview%26from%3D2021-08-01%26to%3D2021-08-31">https://github.com/Elchi3?tab=overview&amp;from=2021-08-01&amp;to=2021-08-31</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Elchi3?tab%3Doverview%26from%3D2021-09-01%26to%3D2021-09-30">https://github.com/Elchi3?tab=overview&amp;from=2021-09-01&amp;to=2021-09-30</a></p>
<p>We then noted the number of reviews on the mdn/content
repository from that reviewer for that month. Then, as before, we
grouped contributors into:</p>
<ul>
<li>OWD staff</li>
<li>Mozilla staff</li>
<li>W3C staff</li>
<li>Other (volunteers and people paid by other
organizations to contribute to MDN)</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#ftnt_ref1">[1]</a>  Note that
MDN’s policy is to squash commits, so usually
1 commit === 1 PR</p>
